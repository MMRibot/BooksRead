#Tracking list of books read.
=============================

>This was created to allow me to keep track of all the books I have read since starting to learn Web Developement.
They will be listed in the same order they were read in.
I have done this to enable planning of further reading based on what has been read.

_This list could be used by anyone aspiring to learn Web or Software Developement for the first time._

==============================

The list is:

1. __Learning Web Design__ - by Jennifer Niederst Robbins
2. __JavaScript for Beginners__ - by Mark Lassof
3. __DOM Scripting -Web Design with JavaScript and the Document Object Model__ - by Jeremy Keith
4. __JavaScript the Good Parts__ - by Douglas Crockford
5. __Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja__ - John Resig (Personally I did not enjoy this book all that much. I would personally read the Definite Guide first and then read the Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja)
6. __JavaScript: the Definitive Guide__ - by David Flanagan (Prepare yourself for the "readATHON")
7. __Seven Databses in Seven Weeks__ - by Eric Redmond & Jim R.Wilson (I did not read the entire book.....only what I needed at the time)
8. __GEO, CouchDB & Node.js__ - by Mark Thompson
9. __Start Small, Stay Small: A Developers's Guide to Launching a Startup__ - by Rob Walling (This book is not a programming book, but a guide to a start-up. It is worth reading)

=============================

I am currently reading:

1. __Node.js the Right Way - Practical, Server-Side JavaScript That Scales__ - by Jim R.Wilson
2. __The lean Startup__ - by Eric Ries
3. __The surprising truth about what motivates us - Drive__ - by Daniel H. Pink

>I will constantly update this list.
